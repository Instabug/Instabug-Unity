## Installation

1. Download [Instabug-Unity](https://github.com/Instabug/Instabug-Unity/releases "Instabug-Unity") package.
2. In your own Unity project, import the package by selecting: 
Assets → Import Package → Custom Package from Unity editor’s menu OR double-clicking Instabug-Unity.unitypackage.
3. Resolve dependencies (for Android).

## Initializing Instabug

1. Create an empty GameObject and add `Instabug.cs` script as a component to it. The script is located in: Assets → Plugins → Instabug
2. Enter your app token, which you can find on the dashboard, and choose the preferred Invocation Event from the inspector window.
3. Add **Event System** component to the newly created GameObject (only if you do not already have an EventSystem game object in the hierarchy of the current scene).

:warning: For iOS builds, you may encounter a build error on some Xcode versions. To resolve it, you can simply set **Validate Workspace** to **Yes** in the Build Settings tab under Build Options in Xcode.

## Migrating from versions prior to v10

1. Remove the Assets/Plugins directory that was previously imported.
2. Follow the [installation steps](#installation).
