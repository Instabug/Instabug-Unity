# Deprecation of Unity Support
Instabug will end support for Unity on June 30, 2025 due to low usage among our user base. This allows us to focus on improving our offerings for more widely adopted platforms and frameworks that align with our developers needs.

## Extended Support
We understand this transition may impact some of our users and are committed to assisting you. If you require extended support for Xamarin, Cordova, or Unity beyond the deprecation date, please reach out to our team.


## Documentation
For more details about the supported APIs and how to use them, you can refer to our [docs](https://docs.instabug.com/docs/unity-overview "**docs**").
